Mainly it has three sections \u2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; 1. Modeling<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; 2. Layout and animation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; 3. Rendering<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modeling is generating 3D objects in a certain scene. The next phase is done by positioning and animating. And the last phase, rendering, is the output of the completed result. The techniques used in 3D Animation involves appearance sketching, appearance modeling, arena building, camera setup, texturing, alteration, bonding, and rendering. Cinema 4D, Autodesk MAYA &amp; Autodesk 3ds Max are the names of some of the best 3D animation software. At Creative IT, we highly focus on Autodesk MAYA and teach our students to be the best in the industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/creativejuniors.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/course\/457"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/creativejuniors.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/course"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/creativejuniors.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/course"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/creativejuniors.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=457"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
